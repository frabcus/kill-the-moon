"Kill the Moon" Electricity Use
===============================

Purple is the "Kill the Moon" broadcast. Other colours are previous episodes in
the same season. Note that programmes started at varying times (see later in
this README).

The dotted line is the time at which Courtney said "night night" as the last
lights on earth visible to Clara went out - that is to say at the very end of
the voting when we might expect peak electricity.

Comparisons with previous episodes are to see if irregular jumps in electricity
are common at that time on a Saturday.
